A fully 3D-designed 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm built using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gCwtqTSA52X-cool-snicket). This model demonstrates the mechanical structure of a robotic arm capable of multi-directional movement and object manipulation using a claw-style end effector.

## 1.  Project Overview :

This robotic arm model was created as part of an academic assignment to design a mechanical manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom. It showcases the structure and joint architecture typically found in real-world robotic arms.

-  Platform: TinkerCAD (3D Design Only)
-  DOF: 5 (Base rotation + 3 arm joints + gripper)
-  Purpose: Educational & conceptual mechanical design

## 2.  Degrees of Freedom Explained : 

1. **Base Rotation (Yaw)** â€“ Enables full rotation of the arm around the vertical axis.
2. **Shoulder Joint** â€“ Allows up/down motion of the arm.
3. **Elbow Joint** â€“ Provides further vertical extension and articulation.
4. **Wrist Joint** â€“ Enables flexible wrist movement.
5. **Gripper (Claw)** â€“ Opens and closes to pick or place objects.

## 4.  Components & Assembly :

- **Base Platform**: Solid foundation to anchor the arm.
- **Rotary Base**: Enables horizontal arm rotation.
- **Three Arm Segments**: Connected using cylindrical joints to allow smooth bending motion.
- **Gripper (End Effector)**: Simulates object manipulation with two gripping fingers.
- **Corner Supports**: Visual balance and aesthetic structure.

## 5.  Objectives : 

- Understand the mechanical structure of multi-joint robotic systems.
- Learn how DOF contributes to range of motion and flexibility.
- Practice accurate 3D modeling with proper alignment and rotation.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements : 

- Add servo motor mounting placeholders for real-world prototyping.
- Animate the movement using TinkerCAD Circuits or external simulation tools.
- Export STL files for 3D printing.
- Integrate Arduino for full control of movement and automation.

## 8. Learnings & Challenges : 

- Precision in joint placement was crucial for realistic movement.
- Ensuring rotational clearance between parts required careful scaling.
- Layered design helped modularize each part of the arm.
