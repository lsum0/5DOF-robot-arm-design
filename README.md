#   5 DOF Robotic Arm – TinkerCAD Design 🦾 : 

A fully 3D-designed 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm built using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/). This model demonstrates the mechanical structure of a robotic arm capable of multi-directional movement and object manipulation using a claw-style end effector.

## 1.  Project Overview :

This robotic arm model was created as part of an academic assignment to design a mechanical manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom. It showcases the structure and joint architecture typically found in real-world robotic arms.

-  Platform: TinkerCAD (3D Design Only)
-  DOF: 5 (Base rotation + 3 arm joints + gripper)
-  Purpose: Educational & conceptual mechanical design

## 2.  Degrees of Freedom Explained : 

1. **Base Rotation (Yaw)** – Enables full rotation of the arm around the vertical axis.
2. **Shoulder Joint** – Allows up/down motion of the arm.
3. **Elbow Joint** – Provides further vertical extension and articulation.
4. **Wrist Joint** – Enables flexible wrist movement.
5. **Gripper (Claw)** – Opens and closes to pick or place objects.

## 🏗️ Components & Assembly

- **Base Platform**: Solid foundation to anchor the arm.
- **Rotary Base**: Enables horizontal arm rotation.
- **Three Arm Segments**: Connected using cylindrical joints to allow smooth bending motion.
- **Gripper (End Effector)**: Simulates object manipulation with two gripping fingers.
- **Corner Supports**: Visual balance and aesthetic structure.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the mechanical structure of multi-joint robotic systems.
- Learn how DOF contributes to range of motion and flexibility.
- Practice accurate 3D modeling with proper alignment and rotation.
